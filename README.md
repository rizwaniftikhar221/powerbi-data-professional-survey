# Data Professional Survey – Power BI Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a Power BI dashboard built to explore survey data from data professionals. The dashboard looks at job roles, salary levels, commonly used tools, and how satisfied people are with their salary and work-life balance.

The main idea was to take a raw survey dataset and turn it into something easy to understand and useful through clear visuals and basic KPIs.

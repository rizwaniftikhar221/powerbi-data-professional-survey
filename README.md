# Data Professional Survey Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## Overview
This project is an exploratory Power BI dashboard created to analyze survey data from data professionals. The dashboard provides insights into job roles, salary trends, skill usage, and job satisfaction within the data industry.

The goal of the project is to transform raw survey data into clear, interactive visuals that help users better understand trends and patterns in data-related careers.

## Business Context
People entering or working in the data field often lack structured information about:
- Common job roles and career paths  
- Salary differences across roles  
- In-demand programming languages  
- Satisfaction with salary and work-life balance  

This dashboard brings these insights together in a single, easy-to-understand view.
